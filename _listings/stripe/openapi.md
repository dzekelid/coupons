        need to create coupons on the fly.A coupon has either a percent_off or an
        amount_off and currency. If you set an amount_off, that amount will be subtracted
        from any invoice\u2019s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal
        of 100 will have a final total of 0 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200
        is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 will have a final total
