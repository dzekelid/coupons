      description: "You can create coupons easily via the coupon management page of
        the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you
        need to create coupons on the fly.A coupon has either a percent_off or an
        amount_off and currency. If you set an amount_off, that amount will be subtracted
        from any invoice\u2019s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal
        of 100 will have a final total of 0 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200
        is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 will have a final total
        of 100 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200 is applied to it."
